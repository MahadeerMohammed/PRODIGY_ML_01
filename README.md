House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression.

## Features

  - This project focuses on predicting house prices using linear regression, a fundamental machine learning technique.
  - The aim is to develop a model that estimates the price of a house based on various input features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes.
  -  Linear regression will be used to explore relationships between these features and house prices and to make predictions on new data.
